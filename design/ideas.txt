## Data modelling ideas..

 - apply star schema in silver layer + define table linkage
   .. This is still aligned with original idea behind medallion design, where data is explorable but no business logic is introduced yet
   .. this may make applying business logic easier, since we would know all the connections across tables at this stage
 

 - support schema from source -> bronze
    (or go straight from source -> silver)
    .. for streaming sources, we may not want to rely on trino transformations, as this will introduce high latency for data readiness


# Dataset onboarding: ideas

 - homebrew install stats: https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/


# Ideas

 - improve cloud storage performance through the use of DirectPV: https://min.io/docs/directpv/concepts/architecture/
 
 - modularize better by not using service names specicially.
 
   e.g. don't call secrets MINIO_XYZ, call them OBJECT_STORAGE_XYZ
 
 - LLM config file creation
